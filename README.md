## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of code is made by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz).

> It's an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
